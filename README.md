## Abstract
In recent years, traditional medicine has conducted various studies on the brain and achieved many results. With the development of computer techniques, we hope to use them to assist medical research. The material we selected was a neuroscience experiment—an experiment in which monkeys played the Pac-Man game. Pac-Man is a popular game that provides a complex and natural decision-making task where the outcome is influenced by many factors. Therefore, analysis of games can intuitively reveal the complex decision-making processes in animal brains. By establishing an artificial intelligence model and using experimental videos for training, it can predict the monkey's next decision when it plays the Pac-Man game, and then analyze the trained model to study how various factors affect brain's decision-making process. In view of the similarity between neural network technology and the structure of brain neurons, the model we established uses deep neural networks.
We divide the task into two stages, feature extraction stage and prediction stage. The CNN model is used in the feature extraction stage. Considering that the brain’s decision-making often has temporal characteristics, we decided to use the LSTM model in the prediction stage. Through training, the model successfully achieved high accuracy of 84%. By using Grad-CAM heatmap, we visualized the model as a whole and layer by layer, making the model more interpretable, and analyzed the convolutional layers under three conditions: capture mode, avoidance mode and foraging mode. The characteristics of the model were used to derive the focus position of the model in different modes and the brain's decision-making strategy at this time, and it was concluded that the decisions made by the model were driven by high returns.
近年来，传统医学对于大脑进行了各种研究，取得了诸多成果。随着计算机的发展，我们希望能够利用计算机来对医学研究进行辅助。我们选取的材料是一个神经科学实验——猴子玩吃豆人游戏的实验。吃豆人是一个很受欢迎的游戏，它提供了一个复杂而自然的决策任务，决策结果会受多方面因素影响。因此，对游戏的分析可以直观地揭示动物大脑中复杂的决策过程。通过建立人工智能模型，使用实验录像进行训练，使其能够预测猴子玩吃豆人游戏时猴子下一步的决策，然后通过分析训练好的人工智能模型来研究各种因素对大脑决策产生了怎样的影响。鉴于神经网络技术与大脑神经元结构具有相似性，我们建立的模型采用深度神经网络。
我们将任务分为两个阶段，特征提取阶段和预测阶段。特征提取阶段采用 CNN 模型，而考虑到大脑做决策往往带有时序特性，预测阶段我们决定采用 LSTM 模型。通过训练，模型成功达到了84%的较高准确率。通过 Grad-CAM 热力图技术我们对模型进行了整体与逐层的可视化，使模型具有了更好的可解释性，并分析了在捕获模式、躲避模式和觅食模式三种条件下卷积层的特征，得出在不同模式下模型重点关注的位置和以及大脑在此时的决策策略，并总结发现模型做出的决定都是高回报驱动的。
